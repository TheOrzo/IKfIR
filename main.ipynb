    "## Project Description\n",
    "### Course description\n",
    "**[Innovative Konzepte zur Programmierung von Industrierobotern](https://ipr.iar.kit.edu/lehrangebote_3804.php)** is an interactive course at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Björn Hein, dealing with new methods of programming industrial robots. The topics covered in this lecture include collision-detection, collision-free path planning, path optimization and the emerging field of Reinforcement Learning. As the conclusion of the lecture, a final project related to one of these topics must be implemented by a team of two course participants.\n",
    "### Task Description\n",
    "Our team's task is to solve the **[Pick-and-Place Environment](https://robosuite.ai/docs/modules/environments.html#pick-and-place)** from Robosuite using Reinforcement Learning. In this simulated environment, a robot arm needs to place four objects from a bin into their designated container. At every initialization of the environment, the location of the objects are randomized and the task is considered successful is the robot arm manages to place every object into their corresponding container. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subtasks:\n",
    "The task (for each object) can be subdivided into the following subtasks:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Reaching: Move to nearest object\n",
    " 2. Grasping: Pick up the object\n",
    " 3. Lifting: Carry object to container\n",
    " 4. Hovering: Drop object into corresponding container\n",
    " 5. Repeat starting at 1. until all objects are placed in their corresponding containers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reward function:\n",
    "The reward function is essential to understanding the behaviour of the robot while interacting with the environment. In robosuite each environment has implemented two different kinds of reward functions. A binary reward rewards the robot only in the case if the object is placed in its corresponding container. We employed the dense reward function which uses reward shaping and rewards the robot for each subtask (like reaching & grasping), these rewards are then added successively. The image below taken from the [python code for the pick-and-place task](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite/blob/eafb81f54ffc104f905ee48a16bb15f059176ad3/robosuite/environments/manipulation/pick_place.py#L260) describes the additional rewards for each subtask:\n",

    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "Employing robosuite on windows is possible (e.g. by using a VM or WSL), but it leads to complications during installation, which is why using a linux or mac computer is highly recommended. Our repository also uses the RL algorithm implementations from the stable release of the stable baselines 3 repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install all dependencies (robosuite, SB3,..) needed for this repository by running the following commmand.\n",
    "More information about their installation can be found in the [robosuite installation guide](https://robosuite.ai/docs/installation.html) and the [SB3 installation guide](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "On debian the non free cuda driver has to be installed as a kernel level module in order to use the GPU for calculations. This change resulted in crashes of wayland DSP so a X11 has to be used as a fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code is writen for python3.11. The following python packages are needed: numpy (below version 2), robosuite, stable-baselines3[extra], libhdf5, h5py"

An additional insight is that changing the parameters responsible for steps taken until a policy update, the horizon and the control frequency of the robot influences the performance of the agent significantly. \n",

    "Further tests were conducted, but the lack of computing performance and the parameters being highly correlated with each other served as a strong bottleneck in solving this high-level task. It is easy to overlook configurations which would enable better performance when the parameters correlate with each other. In most cases, changing a parameter requires adapting the other parameters, otherwise the agent might even perform worse. The success of trying random combinations of parameters manually is very limited, since there is a very high number of possible parameter configurations.\n",

By sampling for each run, called trial, a value for each parameter from a specified range and training a model with these parameters, the model performance can be evaluated based on the mean reward. Optuna then provides after a specified number of trials which hyperparameters lead to the best performance, have the highest influence on model performance and how they correlate to each other.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "As reinforcement learning is still an emerging field, many questions such as which model to use, how much training is needed and how the reward function can be designed or evaluated for a certain task need to be answered. Therefore solving a high-level RL task, such as pick-and-place, requires a structured training and evaluation approach.  New implementations and papers dealing with this topic are published frequently which we made use of while working on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial tests helped us to decide e.g. what robot to use, how many training steps are needed and what  horizon range, leads to the best results based on visual (simulation) and tensor board evaluation. Researching papers and implementations helped us reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Even with initial training and tests, certain hyperparameters we previously glossed over had a stronger influence on the model performance than assumed, such as ent_coeff and ...  which we gathered from using the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating our results we gathered that the subtask \"reaching\" is achievable, the robot moves towards objects and touches them (even in the single-object mode). The main problems are reliable grasping and lifting. It seems that the robot attempts to grasp objects, but has not yet understood how its gripper works, the gripper often gets stuck or \"broken\" during attempts. The objects often get moved around, where they even phase through the walls of the bin. As previously mentioned the bottleneck was the limited computational power in the short time frame of two weeks."
